# MalX Archive  
**Research, experiments, PoCs, and adversarial studies.**

MalX Archive is the knowledge base of the MalX ecosystem.  
It collects experiments, writeups, proofs-of-concept, and execution-flow studies that inform ongoing research.

## Contents
- Malware behaviour analysis  
- Execution-flow experiments  
- Evasion technique breakdowns  
- Adversarial PoCs  
- Research notes and prototypes  

## Purpose
To document the evolution of adversarial research within MalX and provide a reference for future tooling and experimentation.

## Notes
Content may be unstable, experimental, or intentionally incomplete.  
This repository reflects active research, not polished products.
